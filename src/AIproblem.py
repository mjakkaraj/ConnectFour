# This is a parent class from which you can inherit to make a problem class specific to a puzzle/problem.
# For example, you can define a sudoku problem class with "class Sudoku(AIproblem)
# The new class can inherit all attributes and methods from the parent class or you can override each method.
# You can initialize the attributes of the parent by calling AIproblem.__init__(self, ...)

# The intent is to create a problem class that could be used for either a classical search or
# a local search technique, such as Simulated Annealing or Genetic Algorithms

# WARNING: This class has not been used in any substantial way. Please let us know immediately when
# you have an issue so that we can fix it. In the meantime, we will test it more.
